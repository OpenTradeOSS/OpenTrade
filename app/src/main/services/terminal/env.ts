/**
 * Build the environment for an agent's PTY. We inherit the app's env, ensure the
 * usual macOS bin dirs are on PATH (so `claude`, `git`, etc. resolve), and inject
 * OPENTRADE_* identifiers. The hooks-server port/token (OPENTRADE_PORT /
 * OPENTRADE_TOKEN) are layered in by M3.
 *
 * `stripEnvKeys` (set for background/headless runs, from the harness's
 * `subscriptionAuthStrip` list — e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for claude,
 * `OPENAI_API_KEY` for codex) removes API keys from the inherited env so the CLI
 * bills the user's logged-in subscription instead of silently hitting an API key —
 * the whole app env is inherited, so a key in the user's shell would otherwise
 * leak into every unattended run (the "unattended runs bill the API" cost bug).
 *
 * Integration env from the Key Vault (e.g. `PMXT_API_KEY`, which the agents' PMXT MCP
 * entries reference by name) is layered in here — the single choke point every agent
 * spawn (PTY, headless wake, codex app-server) goes through.
